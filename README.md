# UNPeacekeepingDataAnalysis

The goal of this project is to explore any insights fom different datasets of the UN's Peacekeeping website. It is a learning opportunity to see how to analyze it using both Python and GoLang. We can compare how the languages accomplish the same tasks, understanding the pros and cons of using one language over another.

Immediate goals (work in progress): 
- Obtain two datasets and merge together (Python Complete)
- Visualize the data using a tool (TBD on the tool)

Long term:
- Host the code on a server (e.g., Kubernetes)
- Incorporate Frontend (e.g., using React.js)
- Allow user requests with specific dataset inputs
    - Either an API request or a specific input to type
